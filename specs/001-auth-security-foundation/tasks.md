# Tasks: Authentication & Security Foundation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-auth-security-foundation/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume web app structure - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create backend project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Create frontend project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T003 [P] Initialize Python project with FastAPI dependencies in backend/
- [ ] T004 [P] Initialize Next.js project with Better Auth dependencies in frontend/

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T004 Setup Neon Serverless PostgreSQL database schema and migrations framework
- [ ] T005 [P] Implement Better Auth authentication/authorization framework with JWT support in frontend/
- [ ] T006 [P] Setup FastAPI routing and JWT verification middleware structure in backend/src/middleware/
- [ ] T007 Create base User model using SQLModel in backend/src/models/user.py
- [ ] T008 Configure error handling and logging infrastructure with security event logging in backend/src/utils/
- [ ] T009 Setup environment configuration management with BETTER_AUTH_SECRET handling in backend/.env
- [ ] T010 [P] Implement user data isolation enforcement at the API layer in backend/src/auth/
- [ ] T011 Configure Next.js 16+ App Router with auth-aware routing in frontend/src/app/
- [ ] T012 Setup JWT attachment mechanism for all API requests from frontend in frontend/src/lib/api-client.js
- [ ] T013 Create JWT utility functions for token validation in backend/src/auth/jwt_utils.py
- [ ] T014 Implement JWT claims schema definition in backend/src/auth/schemas.py

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Secure Login and API Access (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Enable registered users to securely log in and access their data through the API while keeping information private and protected from unauthorized access.

**Independent Test**: A logged-in user can access their own data via API calls while unauthorized users receive 401 errors.

### Tests for User Story 1 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

> **NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [ ] T015 [P] [US1] Contract test for login endpoint in backend/tests/contract/test_auth.py
- [ ] T016 [P] [US1] Contract test for register endpoint in backend/tests/contract/test_auth.py
- [ ] T017 [P] [US1] Integration test for login → token → API request flow in backend/tests/integration/test_auth_flow.py

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T018 [P] [US1] Create Auth service in backend/src/services/auth_service.py
- [ ] T019 [US1] Implement login endpoint in backend/src/api/auth_routes.py
- [ ] T020 [US1] Implement register endpoint in backend/src/api/auth_routes.py
- [ ] T021 [US1] Add JWT token generation to auth service in backend/src/services/auth_service.py
- [ ] T022 [US1] Create frontend login component in frontend/src/components/LoginForm.jsx
- [ ] T023 [US1] Create frontend registration component in frontend/src/components/RegisterForm.jsx
- [ ] T024 [US1] Implement API client with JWT attachment in frontend/src/lib/api_client.js

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - User Data Isolation (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Ensure that user data is completely isolated from other users' data so that no one else can view or modify their information.

**Independent Test**: Users can only access their own data even when they know other users' IDs.

### Tests for User Story 2 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

- [ ] T025 [P] [US2] Contract test for user data access endpoint in backend/tests/contract/test_user_data.py
- [ ] T026 [P] [US2] Integration test for user isolation in backend/tests/integration/test_user_isolation.py

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T027 [P] [US2] Create Task model in backend/src/models/task.py
- [ ] T028 [US2] Implement user data retrieval endpoint in backend/src/api/user_routes.py
- [ ] T029 [US2] Add user ID validation middleware to compare JWT claims with URL params in backend/src/middleware/user_validation.py
- [ ] T030 [US2] Implement authorization logic to enforce user ownership in backend/src/auth/authorization.py
- [ ] T031 [US2] Create frontend task list component in frontend/src/components/TaskList.jsx
- [ ] T032 [US2] Add error handling for 401/403 responses in frontend/src/lib/error_handler.js

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Secure Session Management (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Securely manage user sessions using JWT tokens so that users don't need to repeatedly log in while maintaining security.

**Independent Test**: JWT validity periods and proper rejection of expired tokens can be verified.

### Tests for User Story 3 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

- [ ] T033 [P] [US3] Contract test for JWT expiry handling in backend/tests/contract/test_jwt_expiry.py
- [ ] T034 [P] [US3] Integration test for session management in backend/tests/integration/test_session_mgmt.py

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T035 [P] [US3] Implement JWT expiry validation in backend/src/auth/jwt_validator.py
- [ ] T036 [US3] Add token refresh mechanism in frontend/src/lib/token_manager.js
- [ ] T037 [US3] Create session persistence mechanism in frontend/src/lib/session_storage.js
- [ ] T038 [US3] Add token expiry notifications in frontend/src/components/TokenExpiryNotifier.jsx

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] T039 [P] Documentation updates in docs/
- [ ] T040 Code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] T041 Performance optimization across all stories
- [ ] T042 [P] Additional unit tests (if requested) in backend/tests/unit/ and frontend/tests/unit/
- [ ] T043 Security hardening
- [ ] T044 Run quickstart.md validation

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):
Task: "Contract test for login endpoint in backend/tests/contract/test_auth.py"
Task: "Contract test for register endpoint in backend/tests/contract/test_auth.py"
Task: "Integration test for login → token → API request flow in backend/tests/integration/test_auth_flow.py"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create Auth service in backend/src/services/auth_service.py"
Task: "Create frontend login component in frontend/src/components/LoginForm.jsx"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
